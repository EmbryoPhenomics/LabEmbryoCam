**An opensource hardware and software platform for phenotyping aquatic embryos**

LabEmbryoCam was developed by the EmbryoPhenomics research group working at the University of Plymouth and Plymouth Science Park - specifically for timelapse, long term imaging of developing aquatic organisms. However, it is a versatile, cost-effective instrument applicable to a broad range of applications, and it is entirely open-source. 

Organisms are dyanmic, particularly during early life, and tools such as the LabEmbryoCam enables an entirely new approach to viewing, measuring and understanding this fundamental period of life. Combined with automated analysis, these resources are being applied to tackling pressing global challenges.

Development of the LabEmbryoCam is made possible thanks to funding from UK Resarch Innovation, Natural Environment Research Council and Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council funding.
