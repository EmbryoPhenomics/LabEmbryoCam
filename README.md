An opensource hardware and software platform for phenotyping aquatic embryos.

LabEmbryoCam was developed by the EmbryoPhenomics research group working at the University of Plymouth and Plymouth Science Park - specifically for timelapse, long term imaging of developing aquatic organisms. However, it is a versatile, cost-effective instrument applicable to a broad range of applications, and it is entirely open-source.

The project is made possible thanks to funding from UK Resarch Innovation, Natural Environment Research Council and Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council funding.
