BILL OF MATERIALS
========
* The LabEmbryoCam is built using commonly available and low-cost consumer electronics, mechanical parts and 3D printed parts. Links and prices are provided as a guide, but prices vary and there is also significant scope for changing components, or suppliers due to availability, price, or user requirements.

* A significant assortment of screws, nuts and washers are required to build a LabEmbryoCam. To simplify the process of sourcing these parts, a kit of the required fixings can be bought here: https://www.modelfixings.co.uk/embryophenomics.htm

* To reduce the number of orders required to source these parts, parts are grouped to a few key suppliers and these are indicated in the bill of materials. Most parts are, however, available from a range of suppliers. There is also considerable scope for changing parts to suit your use case, or budget.
 
* We are based in the UK so have used UK suppliers, but if you are building your own LEC we recommend you use suppliers local to you.

* STLs are the 3D model files, provided for producing the 3D printed parts. There are > 70 3D printed parts, with many requiring multiple copies. The (n) in the name of some parts indicates the number of that part that needs printing. For each section in this build guide, the required parts are listed. See the build guide for further information on 3D printing these parts.

* A .STEP CAD file for each version of the LabEmbryoCam is also provided. Within this online build guide, the design file is shown with particular focus on the relevant aspect of the instrument to help with understanding the assembly process. The CAD file enables manipulation of the model to identify particular features and to clearly see the location of parts during the build process. Where necessary, both V1 and V2 versions of the CAD will be presented.
