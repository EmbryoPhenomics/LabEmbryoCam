Which LEC is right for us?
============

This documentation contains information for building two different versions of the LEC:

LEC V1 - cheaper and less durable and refined, but requiring more effort to manufacture.

LEC V2 - more refined and durable, and available from us as a fully assembled instrument, but more expensive than V1.

The software is universal between the two versions and wherever there are differences in the build process, this is made clear in the documentation.

Two versions of the Bill of Materials (BOM) are provided, but do note that overall costs will not be totally accurate as costs of components do fluctuate.

A further key consideration is that the LEC is an entirely self contained instrument and so can be shipped internationally in a flight case. Reach out to us if you want more information about our experiences of this.
