# 2 - Processing video produced by the LEC instrument

We provide a number of different scripts for viewing and processing the video produced by the LEC instrument:

### Viewers

- **examples/timepoint_viewer.py**
	A simple script for scrolling through video of a single timepoint from an individual subject.
- **examples/multi-timepoint_viewer.py**
	A script for viewing the first image from multiple videos of the same individual. 

### Processing

- **examples/compile_videos.py**
	Script to compile multiple videos of each individual into a single video file per individual.
- **examples/first_frame_compile.py**
	Script to retrieve the first frame of each video for each individual in your experiment, and compiling them into timelapse video files for each individual. 

*Note that these scripts are not a prerequisite for analysing your footage.*
