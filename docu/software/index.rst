============
  
The LabEmbryoCam app is built using Dash, a Python based framework from Plotly. The app enables control of the LabEmbryoCam instrument - including camera, XYZ position and lighting, and it enables the automated control of these during the course of an acquisition.

Additional analytical scripts are provided for integrating the acquired video for each XYZ position, and running various analyses including automated heartrate measurement and embryo size measurement.
