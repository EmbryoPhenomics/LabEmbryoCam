Evaporation and condensation are key challenges in the maintenance and visualisation of developing aquatic 
embryos. 

A cheap solution to this challenge, is a 3D printed humidifiction chamber. This humidification module is 
succesful in achieving > 90 % humidity, thereby reducing evaporation to negligible levels. It is not, however, essential to the succesful 
operation of the LabEmbryoCam, for which multiwell plate and petri dish mounts are avaialable, in addition to 
a mount for the humidification module described below.
