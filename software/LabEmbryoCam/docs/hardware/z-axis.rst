Tighten the leadscrew nut onto the carriage assembly and the coupling onto the light assembly.

The z-axis assembly consists of a carriage holding a z-axis assembly that moves the camera and light up and down.

**Z-axis**

Begin by assembling the x-axis carriage - sitting on the linear rail carriage. Before attaching to the linear rail 
carriage put cable ties for holding the linear bearings through the carriage part. This is harder to do once 
the linear rail and carriage are attached.

Now, begin assembling the x-axis assembly. The sequence of assembly is important.

1. Slide the xx mm smooth rods to the front of the z-axis carriage and insert the linear bearings onto each rod
   (Fig. 1. below)

2. Attach the z-axis slimmer stepper motor to the back of the z-axis assembly (Fig. 2. below). 
   
3. Attach the optics rail to the front of the z-axis assembly (Fig. 3 below).
   
4. The two xx mm rods can now be inserted into the back of the carriage, with a linear bearing on each, but 
   this must be done with the assembly attached to the linear rail (Fig. 4 below).

To get the carriage assembly square - with the rods fully inserted into the top of the carriage assembly, pressure 
is required. Here, a clamp is helpful.

Once the four rails are inserted into the four linear bearings, add the flexible coupling to the stepper motor shaft.
Note: that the coupler should have a thick and thin end. Put the thin end onto the stepper motor shaft, and then 
thread the leadscrew down from above through the two leadscrew nut and coupler (in the light assemblies and z-carriage) -
see CAD window at top of page if unsure.

5. Finally, attach the LED ring light to the light assembly. Before doing so, four wires will need to be soldered
onto the LED ring, and should be long enough to reach the microcontroller at the back of the instrument (approx. 60 cm).
