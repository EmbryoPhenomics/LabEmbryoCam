The x-axis assembly consists of attaching the piece of 2020 extrusion that carries the carriage containing the optics etc.

Begin, by attaching the large left and right printed pieces to the linear rail carriages (these should be hanging from the linear rails underneath the 2040 extrusion 
running front to back. Once these are attached, the xx mm pieces of 2020 extrusion should sit comfortably on these pieces, and can be attached using bolts and 
slide nuts, as seen in the CAD window below.

**x-axis**

Each x-axis end pieces incorporates four pulleys, as used in the front corners. Check the CAD model for the location of these.

Now, attach the top pieces of the x-axis ends, ensuring that the pulleys and various bolts are inserted.
