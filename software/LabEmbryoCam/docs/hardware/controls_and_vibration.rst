Manual controls
---------------
Solder cables to each of the pins on the joystick (2 x 3 cables per axis), and two buttons (2 x 2 cables) and 
then attach these to the 3D printed front panels. Ensure the cables are labelled to ensure they can be connected 
appropriately to the microcontroller. Once the joystick and buttons are attached to the front panels, the 
front panels can be attached to the LabEmbryoCam.

Vibration insulation
---------------
Attach the sorbothene feet to each of the four leaf spring printed parts, before then attaching to the inner 
corner of each bottom corner of the instrument.

Attaching panels
---------------
While not essential, attaching plastic panels to the instrument is encouraged as for little cost, they  
help to keep the instrument clean, and looking tidy. Note the size of the panels required in the bill of materials and their 
locations above. Before installing the panels, insert M3 square nuts into the holes at the top and bottom of 
each spacer. The square nuts should slide as far as they can be pushed, using a small allen key or similar, so 
that the hole in the nut aligns with the hole in the 3D printed spacer.
