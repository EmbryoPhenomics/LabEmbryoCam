LabEmbryoCam
=============================================
**An opensource platform for automated measurement of developing animals**

*The LabEmbryoCam is a project originating with the EmbryoPhenomics research group at the University of Plymouth, UK. 
It has been made possible by support from UKRI, NERC, BBSRC and Plymouth Science Park*

The LabEmbryoCam provides:
   * **Automated movement of a camera and lighting in the X, Y and Z direction, over prolonged periods** *making it well suited to recording the process of embryonic development in aquatic animals*
   * **A custom user interface for easy setup of experiments, within a multiwell plate format,** *but also has sufficient flexibility for other culture formats - petri dishes, or even custom culture solutions*
   * **Incorporates an optional humifidification chamber to significantly reduce evaportation** *thereby solving one of the key challenges of long term timelapse imaging of aquatic animals*
   * **Vibration dampening** *addressing vibration, the enemy of timelapse imaging. LabEmbryoCam incorporates sorbothene feet, 3D printed leafsprings and cable dampeners to minimise its effects on your imaging*
   * **A low cost, modular and versatile phenotyping platform** *taking advantage of 3D printed parts, single board computers, microcontrollers, stepper motors and lower cost cameras and lenses*
   * **Hackability** *this is an active project - if in doubt about any aspect of this instrument and its suitability to your activities, just ask*

The LabEmbryoCam consists of both hardware and software, and the process of building both is described
in the following series of pages.
