	- **Replace:** Press this button to replace the coordinates of the selected position with those at the current position of the stage. This can be used to update a position if an animal has moved or gone out of focus. Note that you must select a position in the position list via clicking on the circle icon in the second column of the position list for the position you'd like to replace. 
- **E - Position list table**

The second column is to permit selection of specific position entries for updating their coordinates. Finally, columns `X`, `Y`, `Z` and `Label` are all editable similar to an excel spreadsheet.
- **E - Activate graph**
	Enabling this switch will allow you to click on positions on the graph and then the stage will move to the select position. This can be an easy way to double-check all you positions are correct whilst you have a live stream open.
- **F - 2D/3D graph view**
	Enabling this switch can switch between 2D (as shown above) or 3D view, 3D view can be useful for checking the z axis positions.
